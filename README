This project holds the software to build, update, and access the database
for the DAPD1Servlet project - a DAP-DataONE broker. The database is used
to hold all of the information about a DAP dataset that the DAP-DataONE 
server will need to build responses to the DataONE tier 1 member node
REST API.

This project uses SQLite for the database. It includes a sample database,
a shell script that is a simple command line tool to edit and update the
database and some other support files.

Building the code

This project and its companion use Maven. Build it using 'mvn install'.

Configuration

See the online docs at http://opendap.github.io/DAPD1DatasetsDatabase for 
help on building a database for your datasets.
